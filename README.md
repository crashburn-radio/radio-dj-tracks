# Tracks for the radio-dj project

All tracks here are used for manual tests of the radio-dj2 project.
None of the Tracks should break any copy right law.

all *tracks* are created by my in a very short time with sample packes from
[samplemagic](https://www.samplemagic.com/)

They should just simulate genre structure,
and are not made for entertainment purpose.
